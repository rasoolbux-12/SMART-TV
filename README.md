# Smart TV Simulation ðŸ“º

A Java-based console application that simulates a Smart TV system using core Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as **inheritance**, **composition**, **aggregation**, and **multithreading**.

## Features
- Simulates a Smart TV with a screen, remote control, and software update functionality.
- Implements OOP principles:
  - **Inheritance:** SmartTV extends Television which extends ElectronicAppliance.
  - **Composition:** SmartTV has a Screen and SoftwareUpdate as part of its internal components.
  - **Aggregation:** RemoteControl exists independently and is used by the TV.
  - **Threading:** Background software updates run using a separate thread.
- Interactive console-based menu for user input.

## How It Works
1. The user is greeted with a menu of Smart TV options.
2. Options include turning the TV on/off, changing channels, adjusting volume, browsing apps, and checking for software updates.
3. The remote control manages channel and volume functions.
4. The software update feature simulates checking for updates using multithreading.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code
- **Concepts:** OOP (Inheritance, Composition, Aggregation), Java Threads, Scanner for user input
